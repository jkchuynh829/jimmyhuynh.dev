Woo hoo!

This is the first blog post on my website, which I built to learn new things and keep my skills sharp! This post will probably change, but I just wanted to ship this baby as soon as possible.

If you're wondering why this site is so blazingly fast, it's because there's not much going on.... It's a bunch of static web pages I built with Gatsby.js. If you're a React person looking to quickly spin up a blog, Gatsby.js is currently my favorite tool for the job. With a robust ecosystem with plugins, themes, and starters, I managed to deploy a first version in less than an hour!

For blogs specifically, there's a ton of Gatsby starters that come with CMS integrations like Contentful. With Netlify, you can deploy with CMS integration out-of-the-box!

More on this later...
