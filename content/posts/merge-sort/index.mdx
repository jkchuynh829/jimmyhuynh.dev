Everyone can get a little rusty on their algorithms and data structures. Do front end devs need to know algorithms? The short answer is yes &mdash; solving algorithms shows interviewers how you can think through a problem. It helps them glean on how you will reason about complex problems in your business logic or application.

That being said, I could use the practice. I plan on posting solutions to challenges I run into during interviews and ones I know are common. Today, we'll start with a recursive sorting algorithm &mdash; merge sort! Let's dust off some cobwebs ðŸ•¸, shall we?

I'll show the solution before breaking it down part by part. Here it is:

```js
function mergeSort(arr) {
  if (arr.length === 1) return arr;
  const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
  const left = arr.slice(0, mid);
  const right = arr.slice(mid);
  return merge(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));
}

function merge(left, right) {
  const merged = [];
  
  let indexLeft = 0;
  let indexRight = 0;

  while(indexLeft < left.length && indexRight < right.length) {
    if (left[indexLeft] < right[indexRight]) {
      merged.push(left[indexLeft]);
      leftIndex += 1;
    } else {
      merged.push(right[indexRight]);
      rightIndex += 1;
    }
  }

  return merged
    .concat(left.slice(leftIndex))
    .concat(right.slice(rightIndex));
}
```

#### Some things to know about Merge Sort

Merge sort is a "divide-and-conquer" algorithm. This is paradigm in which the problem is broken down into subproblems. A subproblem is a smaller version of the original problem. The solution to the original problem is made up of a combination of the solutions to the it's subproblems. Uh, what? I just confused myself so let's try visualizing the solution.

So here's what's happening...

1. Determine the base case. Here, it's when an array only has one value. Instead of calling `mergeSort` again, return the array. It's common to always start by figuring out what your base case is. You'll blow your call stack without one. You should definitely blow your call stack sometimes, though &mdash; it's fun!
1. Split the array in half over and over (...and over).
1. Do work to solve each subproblem. This involves a simple comparison between the values at index 0 for each array (left and right). 2 and 3 are done over and over (recursively) until 1 (the base case) is reached.
1. Combine (merge) the solutions to each subproblem.

Here's an animation that might fill in some gaps the image might have left.

#### Time complexity

If you're wondering about time complexity, merge sort is `O(n log n)`. I'll try my best to explain why. When breaking up merge sort into it's required operations, we get...

1. Whenever we can divide something in half at each iteration or recursive call (a level), we know that it can be represented using a logarithmic function. This is the "divide" part or number 2 in the above example.
1. When we perform the comparison to solve our subproblems and combine each of them, a `O(n)` time complexity is required. That's `n` elements must be compared.

Thus, for `n` elements, we will have `log n` levels, and for each level we have to do `n` comparisons. That's why we get `O(n * log n)`.

Whew!

#### Breaking it down

Let's take a look at `mergeSort`.

First, determine the base case!

```js
function mergeSort(arr) {
  if (array.length === 1) return arr; // When there's only one value, return the array
  // ...
}
```

After that, we have to split the array in half:
```js
function mergeSort(arr) {
  // ...
  const middle = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
  const left = arr.splice(0, middle);
  const right = arr.splice(middle);
  // ...
}
```

You may have noticed that this solution has a helper function called `merge`. This is where our comparison takes place, so `merge` plays a big role.

We want to first create an empty array, which we will ultimate return as result of our merging operations. We then also initialize `indexLeft` and `indexRight` to `0`. I find it easier to reason about iterating through two arrays with a `while` loop so we'll need these variables to keep track of where we are in each array.

```js
function merge(left, right) {
  const merged = [];

  let indexLeft = 0;
  let indexRight = 0;

  // ...
}
```

The comparison operation is actually really simple.

1. Compare the value at the current index of each array. Both arrays start at index `0`.

```js
function merge(left, right) {
  const merged = [];

  let indexLeft = 0;
  let indexRight = 0;

  // ...

}
```

2. Push the lower value to the `merged` array and increment that original array's index variable by 1.

```js
function merge(left, right) {
  //...

  // iterate through right and left arrays until you reach the end of one array
  while (indexLeft < left.length && indexRight < right.length) {

    // if the value at `indexLeft` in array `left` is smaller...
    if (left[indexLeft] < right[indexRight]) {

      // push that value to the `merged` array
      merged.push(left[indexLeft]);

      // increment the `indexLeft` by 1 so that the next value in `left` can be compared
      indexLeft += 1;
    } else {

      // otherwise, push the value at `indexRight` in array `right`
      merged.push(right[indexRight]);

      // increment the `right` array's `indexRight` by 1
      indexRight += 1;
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

3. Repeat while both arrays have values to compare.
1. After the while loop breaks, there will be some values left in either the left or right arrays. We have to add concatenate those to the resulting array before returning.

```js
function merge(left, right) {
  // ...

  // return resulting merged array
  return merged
    // if we didn't reach the end of the `left` array, concatenate the remaining value
    .concat(left.slice(indexLeft))
    // same for the `right` array
    .concat(right.slice(indexRight));
}
```

I want to show you this animation again, since it will remind us what `merge` is really doing.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Merge-sort-example-300px.gif" alt-text="Merge sort animation" />

That was a big detour, but we're finally at the last step of our recursive `mergeSort` solution. We can perform `mergeSort` recursively on each array and then pass the resuls to `merge`. Then return that!

```js
function mergeSort(arr) {
  // ...

  // Calls `mergeSort` recursively, splitting each array in half until the base case is met
  const sortedLeft = mergeSort(left);
  const sortedRight = mergeSort(right);

  // Merge the sorted arrays
  return merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight);
}
```

And that's the solution!

To dig in even deeper, I suggest visualizing what your call stack looks like with each call of `mergeSort`. Using a relatively small sample array, diagram each execution context created by every `mergeSort` call and step through each line in your code. I'll go deeper into this in a future post, I promise!

#### Wrapping things up

Merge sort is often the fastest solution for many problems. There are best case scenarios where "naive" sorting algorithms like bubble sort are actually faster. In an interview situation, be prepared to at least speak on merge sort and how it works.
